# Panda Treat Operation

:::info[Note]

This section assumes that you have already assembled and installed the Panda Treat onto your printer using the instructions provided in the hardware section.

:::

## First-time setup

After the Panda Treat has been installed and the printer has been turned on, the Panda Treat displays a QR code for first-time setup.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/factory-reset-lcd-pixel-circle.webp').default} width="120"/>

Scan the QR code with a phone or computer to connect to the WiFi hotspot that the Panda Treat hosts for the setup process. You may need to tap on a pop-up when scanning the QR code to get your device to act on it. It may take up to 30 seconds to connect to the Panda Treat hotspot, and you may need to open the browser on your device to prompt your device to automatically navigate to the Panda Treat setup page.

The browser may show `No internet connection` during setup; this is normal because the device is connected directly to the Panda Treat access point. When the setup page loads, it should look like the image below. If this has not loaded within 60 seconds of scanning the QR code, you can access the configuration page directly by going to your web browser, typing `192.168.254.1`, and pressing enter.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/captive-portal.webp').default} width="256"/>

Select the preferred language and press `Next`. On the WiFi page, tap `Scan` and once the scan is complete, select the same local WiFi network that the printer uses, enter the WiFi password, and press `Connect`.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/wifi-selection.webp').default} width="256"/>

Leave the browser page open while the Panda Treat connects to the selected network. If you close the page by mistake at any point or if you disconnect from the Panda Treat hotspot, you can get back to the WiFi setup page by scanning the QR code on the screen again. When the connection is successful, press `Binding` to continue to the printer binding page, or press `Cancel` if you need to remain on the WiFi & IP page.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/wifi-connected-binding.webp').default} width="50%"/>

On the `Bind to Printer` page, press `Scan` to search for available printers. The scan can take up to 60 seconds to complete. Select the printer that you have installed the Panda Treat onto from the list when it appears. If your printer is not found, check that the Panda Treat is on the same WiFi network as the printer and that the printer is turned on. Guest networks are not recommended because they often block communication between devices.

If all of these are true and the printer is still not found, you will need to enter the details manually. Enter the printer serial number (SN), access code, and printer IP from the printer settings screens as shown below.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/find-access-code.webp').default} width="70%"/>

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/binding-to-printer.webp').default} width="256"/>

Press `Bind` once the printer details are correct. When `Binding successful` appears, the Panda Treat has been bound to the designated printer. The display on the Panda Treat will then be animated according to the printer status.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/bound-to-printer.webp').default} width="256"/>

After WiFi and printer binding are complete, use `pandatreat.local` from a device on the same network for normal Panda Treat operation.

## Software updates

The Panda Treat will receive software updates from time to time which will add general improvements to the product and possibly enable additional functionality. It is highly recommended to check for software updates regularly and in particular directly after the first-time setup.

The easiest way to check for software updates is to allow the Panda Treat to automatically check. It will do this whenever it is connected to a WiFi network that has an internet connection. If an update is available, the display will show an image like the one below. Scan the QR code with your device that is on the same WiFi network as the Panda Treat and it will take you to the page that allows you to install the update.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/update-rounded.webp').default} width="120"/>

You can also access the page manually by clicking on the settings option from the hamburger menu in the top right.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/access-settings-menu.webp').default} width="70%"/>

When the page loads, you should be presented with a pop-up that informs you that an update is available. Select `Confirm` to proceed with the update. During the update, the Panda Treat should remain connected to the internet and you should not remove power. Updates will often occur in two stages with progress indicators being provided via the web UI as well as via the Panda Treat display.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/update-available-popup.webp').default} width="360"/>

If your Panda Treat is not connected to the internet, you can still download and install update files manually. To apply an update manually first download the latest software from [CMYLabs/PandaTreat releases](https://github.com/CMYLabs/PandaTreat/releases).

After that, navigate to the settings menu and click on `Manual update`. For a firmware update, select the file that contains `firmware` in the filename. For a UI update, select the file that contains `UI` in the filename.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/manual-update.webp').default} width="70%"/>

Once the update has been installed, the Panda Treat will reboot and reconnect to the WiFi network.

## Settings

The Panda Treat has various settings that allow you to adjust the print quality and other important functions.

Access the settings menu by clicking on the settings option from the hamburger menu in the top right and then navigating to the settings tab on the bottom right of the page that is shown.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/access-settings-menu.webp').default} width="70%"/>

The software versions and updates are covered in the software updates section. The other available settings are:

- `Ink Strip Spacing`: Adjusts the spacing used between print passes. This allows you to increase or decrease the spacing between each line that is printed. It is useful if you notice overlaps or gaps between the printed lines even after cleaning the cartridge. The troubleshooting section contains more information about how to use this setting.
- `Set Emergency Stop`: Should remain enabled unless instructed otherwise for a specific diagnostic procedure.
- `Factory Reset`: Restores the Panda Treat to factory settings.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/settings-page.webp').default} width="70%"/>

## Printing onto items

### Required

When using the Panda Treat, you will be printing onto items that have specific width, length, and height. You need to tell the Panda Treat what these measurements are.

To measure the width, length, and/or diameter of an object you can use a simple ruler or a more complex but accurate tool such as vernier callipers. You can also print your own vernier callipers using the link provided below.

To measure the height, we recommend using the printable tool shown below. The arm can swing over the object that you plan to print onto and this allows you to check the consistency of the surface and ensure that there are no high points that may catch.

### Non-custom shape preparation workflow

You are now at the stage when you get to print onto an object. The following steps guide you through the printing process for a non-custom shape.

First, make sure that your print surface has been made food-safe. Do this by laying down a piece of silicone baking sheet or parchment paper that fits within the boundary of the printer build plate.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/prepared-surface.webp').default} width="45%"/>

Next, access the printing interface on the Panda Treat. You can do this by scanning the QR code on the Panda Treat display using your device. You should always be on the same WiFi network as the Panda Treat when doing this.

:::info[Note]

After you scan the code, it is recommended that you bookmark the page and add it to your home screen as a shortcut so that you can get quick access to it whenever you need it.

:::

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/qr-to-print-page.webp').default} width="70%"/>

From the landing page, choose the type of item you want to print onto. `Cookie / Cake` is used for solid items and `Beverage` is used for drinks or surfaces such as foam.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/item-type-selection.webp').default} width="70%"/>

Choose the shape that best matches the item (A). For a simple cookie, cake, or drink surface, use the circular or square options. The custom shape workflow is covered in another part of this guide.

Enter the dimensions of the object that you are printing onto (B). Even if you will only be printing onto a smaller part of the object, it is recommended to measure the dimensions of the full object and then scale the image using the zoom slider (E) so that it fits to the smaller area that you plan to print onto. If you enter dimensions that are smaller than the object, you may find it difficult to place the object within the alignment markers that are printed at a later step.

:::info[Height]

The height is the most important value because an incorrect height can cause the printhead to drag across the object. Measure the item carefully and add a small safety margin if the surface is uneven.

:::

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/print-workflow-a-to-e.webp').default} width="70%"/>

Click on the image box (C) to upload the image that you want to print. Once the image is uploaded, you can move it around and scale it so that it is positioned correctly on the object. The red outline represents the outline of the object according to the dimensions that you entered earlier.

If you plan to print this repeatedly, you can opt to make it one of your favourite prints (D). This will keep it permanently stored within the printer memory instead of overwriting it with the next print that you send. Selecting this option will require you to provide a name for the favourite so that you can identify the file on the printer using that name in the future.

Next, you need to send the files to the printer. There are two types of files that you can send: marker files (F) and image files (G). Marker files print directly onto your food-safe surface to show you where to place the object. Print files are printed after the object has been placed on the surface. If you already know where to place the object then there is no need to send the marker file and you can proceed directly to sending the image file.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/print-workflow-f-to-g.webp').default} width="70%"/>

After selecting either file type to send to the printer, you will see a small pop-up that provides you with the upload status.

<ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/uploading-print.webp').default} width="300"/>

### Custom shape preparation workflow

Coming soon.

### Printing workflow

Once the image and optionally the marker files have been prepared and sent to the printer, you are ready to start printing. Follow this workflow to make sure that you get successful prints.

1. Wipe the bottom of your cartridge using the method mentioned in the cartridge maintenance and care section.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/wiping-cartridge.webp').default} width="50%"/>

2. Navigate to the print menu of your printer where you will see up to three different prints for each image that you send.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/print-files-on-printer.webp').default} width="70%"/>

    - `Preparation print`: This will home the printer and move the bed to a position where you can place the object on it. It is required before you perform the first image print if you have not prepared the printer in the last 15 minutes.
    - `Marker print`: This will prepare the printer and print markers onto your food-safe surface to show you where to position your object.
    - `Image print`: This is the print that will ultimately go onto your object. It should only ever be run after you have prepared the printer.

    :::info[Note]

    Never have the object on the surface when you run the marker print as it will collide with the printhead.

    :::

3. If you need to print the marker file, tap that option and make sure that all of the options on the right-hand side are disabled by tapping them and ensuring that there is no green outline around any of them.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/disable-options.webp').default} width="70%"/>

4. If you are printing the marker file or the preparation file, take this chance to make sure that there is no object at all on the print surface. Once you are sure, tap print.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/filament-review-screen.webp').default} width="70%"/>

5. The printer will perform some preparation steps and then print the desired file. If you hear loud beeping coming from the Panda Treat at any point during the preparation then this is a warning that you have not run the required preparation print file and you should stop the print immediately and run the required preparation file. If the printer has not been prepared, you will see this on the Panda Treat screen.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/not-prepared-rounded.webp').default} width="120"/>

6. If the file prints successfully, you will either have:

    - A marker on the print surface.
    - A printer in a prepared state.
    - An object with your image printed onto it.

7. Assuming that you simply printed the marker file, you will have a marker in red on your print surface that looks like this.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/marker-outline.webp').default} width="45%"/>

8. Place the object within the outline as shown below.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/object-on-plate.webp').default} width="45%"/>

9. Print the image file and watch as your treat receives the print.

    <ImageView src={require('@site/docs/panda-series/module/panda-treat/img/printed-object.webp').default} width="45%"/>

If you want the colours to be more saturated, leave your treat in position and tap `Reprint` on the printer screen.

## Print quality

Panda Treat print quality depends on cartridge condition, object placement, printer motion, and ink strip spacing. If print quality is poor, check the simple causes first before changing settings.

- Missing colours or broken lines usually indicate that the cartridge needs to be wiped or has been stored incorrectly. See the section on cartridge care.
- Large placement errors usually indicate that the marker was not printed first or the object moved after placement.
- Very obvious gaps or dark lines between passes may indicate Y-axis movement or strip spacing issues. Re-check belt tension and then adjust `Ink Strip Spacing` in small `0.01` increments if needed. See the settings section.
- If the printhead drags across the item, stop and re-measure the object height. Increase the height value slightly before trying again.
- Use `Troubleshooting` from the landing page for guided checks when available.
- If a problem repeats after the cartridge has been cleaned, the printer has been prepared, and the object height is correct, record a clear photo of the artefact and the settings used so support can diagnose the issue.
